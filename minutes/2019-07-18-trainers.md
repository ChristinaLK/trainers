### Topic of the Month: Membership

Membership - with a focus on things that are relevant for trainers

* "organizations" not "personal" embership program
* levels: silver, gold, platinum. includes a give number of coordinated workshops and number of trained instructors. platnimum is highly flexible and vague
* by the numbers: 80 members per year with 85% renewal. very little outreach; most people are contacting us
* trainers in membership have been written into platinum agreements. when these trainers teach instructor training workshosp, there time is being financially compensated by their employeer. However, there's a challenge with there is only 1 trainer at an institution. also have a screen and checks in place to make sure all the values are aligned (usually everyone has already been actively involved in the Carpentries). 
* What about instructors who aren't active in the Carpentries. Should we continue training people who don't become active and/or don't checkout?

* 85% of members use memberships to run Carpentries workshops
* 73% of members use membership to build capacity to run self-organized workshops
* 55% of members use membership as a way to learn best teaching practices
* 40% of members use membership for professional development
* 83% use membership to build local community
* 74% some people just want to give back to our community!!!
* 49% come from library or research compute center
* 18% are fullilling a mandate from their department or center to teach computational workshops


Top 5 additions to meet goals

* resources for community building
* curriculum develop training
* learner support (not something we have focused on much)
* more varied membership model
* carpentrycon registration fees
* local trainer
* more instructor support
* onboarding meeting to better understand the membership program
* connections with other member organizations
* options for training that doesn't require two full consecutive days

Grand plan

* most people would recommend the carpentires (8-10) but a few are less certain (5-7)
* Chopportunity: a challenge that is the same time an opportunity. a challenging opportunity.
* Equity, inclusion, and accessibility is part of our core values, but has not quite been incoporated into our membership program
* aligning the values of members with our values will be critical in the future, especially for ogranizations who see the Carpentries "as a service"
* supporting member organization in community organization/development
* balancing membership benefits with open access
* need to explicitly diversify the membership program, aka v2.  also, make it transparent (currently platninum is not transparent)

Comments

* KL. Really great to hear that the model, which was setup 4 years ago, has been successful!
* LA. The fee for membership is too high for a Latin American institution. The fees are as high as someone's salary.

### Discussion Notes

Brian Ballsun-Stanton (Post 2019-07-18-ttt-macquarie) and Jonah Duckles
* great chemistry with instructors and a great class vibe
* the schedule as posted meant that breaks were very late (11:10). might be better to have it at 90 minutes.
* SB gave more breaks, a 5 min and 10 min so that it was enver more than an hour an 10 min without a break : 
* https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12AYI-pXYP5MjaZ42aYUdhGvL12oYnQCNePwmS713WNo/edit#gid=0
* CK: maybe communicate with your co-instructors and your learns about your timeing philosophy
* some discrepancy with "contribution" as to whether or not any contributin is okay verssus only lesson contributions
* related, also worth thinking about "active" or "inactive" lessons that are under developed
* My email template for week before: https://gist.github.com/Denubis/c0f764afb7731b146a6eca3d6b4a1436
* Other feedback: It'd be great to have a page inside docs.carpentries.org which has the checkout checklist. I keep looking in the wrong place for the list which seems like it resides in the instructor training repo
* I'm also really glad I made my etherhub template exporter https://denubis.github.io/instructor-training/etherpad/index.html (which is also in a PR)

Brian Ballsun-Stanton  &  Masami's workshop in May
* noticed that there was too much "homework" information to give at the end of the day. 
* solutions for this are to include the information in the preworkshop email and or earlier in the day. 


Template emails:
* what is the standard?
* where should we keep catalogs? maybe add links to the handbooks
    
Demos: can we checkout people who were in our training   
* goal is to preserve the integrety of the checkout process.
